# public_speaker_training
Slides, handouts, and facilitator resources to deliver introductory public_speaker_training to AWS user groups (and other groups too I suppose)

For facilitators: Start with the [overview video](https://youtu.be/glulS7Yv59M?si=DI4eOnwgA-wIlMbL). The slides in the facilitator resources give overview information on the course and tips for facilitating it successfully with your group.  The Word document in this same folder is an editable version of the handout within the student resources.  I have included this in case you would like to modify any of the activities to better fit with your community.

The student resources include the slide deck to use for leading the course as well as the handout materials to be provided to the learners.

If you lead this training with your user group, please email me and let me know how it went!  DaveBuildsCloud@gmail.com
